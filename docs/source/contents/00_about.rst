The documentation in this portal describes the workflows, procedures, and philosophy for migrating content from the
University of Tennessee's various repository to Hyku. Where possible, specific procedures are not only described but
also justified.

The documentation also includes information about running `our application <https://github.com/scientist-softserv/utk-hyku>`_
locally.
